# circle-kotlin

A simple android application written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), consuming the  the [circle-ci api](https://circleci.com/docs/api). 

The application will allow you to view your projects, builds, branches - and let you download artifacts to your phone.

This is mainly being used as a way to learn [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and hopefully help others who are trying to learn it.
